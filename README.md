This is a simple console based drawer.

Requires maven3 and java10 to build the project.
Use `mvn clean package` to build the 'fat' jar.
Execute using `java -jar drawer-console-1.0.jar`

NOTE:
There're missing unit tests for `org.drawer.console.commands.BucketFillCommand`,
`org.drawer.console.commands.RectangleConsoleCommand` and `org.drawer.console.Application`
due to lack of time
